# human-vs-ai-chess-minimax
This project implements a simplified **Human vs AI Chess Game** in Python using the **Minimax Algorithm** (with optional Alpha-Beta Pruning) as part of our Spring 2025 Artificial Intelligence course.  It includes a complete object-oriented design, supports standard chess rules and mechanics, and features a GUI for interaction.
